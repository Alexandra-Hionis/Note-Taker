## Note Taker
## Description
This application can be used to write, save, and delete notes. It will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. My contribution is to build the backend of this application for UPenn LPS coding bootcamp 2020 and will be displayed on on Heroku.

## Installation
node.js, npm and Express must be installed.
## Usage
AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes.
I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before.
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.

In a business context, it's for users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.
